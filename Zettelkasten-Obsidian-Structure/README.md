## Zettelkasten Method: How to Take Smart Notes

> *This is the Zettelkasten guide I wish existed when I started…*

### Why note-taking?
- **Think better, not just remember.**  
- Capture **fleeting notes** → refine into **literature notes** → distill into **atomic permanent notes**.
- Links are **checkpoints of thought trails**; UIDs keep connections intact as titles evolve.

### Core Principles
1. **Atomic Zettels** – one idea per note, with a UID prefix (e.g. `20250715a`).
2. **Link generously**, always with context (“See why X relates to Y…”).
3. **Structure Notes** (Maps of Content) emerge **bottom-up**, not predetermined.
4. **Decentralization** – let hierarchies form naturally from your web of notes.
5. **Future-proof** – plain-text `.md`, use the Principle of Least Power.

### Workflow
1. **Capture** in `00 Inbox` or `01 Fleeting Notes`.
2. **Elaborate** into literature notes: non-verbatim summaries + your thoughts.
3. **Distill** atomic ideas into `03 Permanent Notes`, assign a UID.
4. **Connect** by linking from existing notes, add context.
5. **Build** or update MOCs in `04 Maps of Content`.
